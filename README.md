# Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap

### SSH
1. Introduction to SSH
    - Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol
        - HTTP is a protocol that allows you to send and receive data over the internet
        - FTP (file transfer protocol) is a protocol that allows you to transfer files over the internet
        - HTTPS is similar to HTTP but it is encrypted
        - SSH allows two computers to communicate securely over an unsecured network
    - SSH allows users to connect to a remote computer and execute commands on it
    - A shell is a program that allows you to interact with the operating system as opposed to a browser which is a program that allows you to interact with the internet
    - The significant advantage of SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to secure the communication between host and client
        - Host = remote server being accessed
        - Client = computer that is accessing the remote server
2. SSH Command
    - `ssh [username]@[host]`
